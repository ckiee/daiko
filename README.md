daiko is...

- a [Discord](https://discord.com) bot for my personal server
- a scraper for my school's lesson scheduling
- an interface to various messaging platforms. (SMS, Discord, TTS calling soon)
- an intergration with [PluralKit](https://pluralkit.me) to automatically suggest registering switches
- a wake time & shower tracker
- ...and everything else I will think of~

## Usage

Read the code (or [the code](https://github.com/ckiee/nixfiles/blob/master/modules/services/daiko.nix) that deploys it) to learn how it works since I'm not really expecting anyone else to use this.
The configuration schema lives in `src/config.ts` - read it and plop a `config.json` down in your working directory.
