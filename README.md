new README under construction as i'm merging this with [sysyelper](https://github.com/ckiee/sysyelper)
<hr>
This program scrapes my [school's schedule](https://iscool.co.il) to send my mom an SMS using Twilio with the amount of sandwiches required for tomorrow based on the number and size of breaks.

## Setup
Have a look [for yourself](https://github.com/ckiee/nixfiles/blob/7777e15a7952eb0de7f453229a4bf17102147cfb/modules/services/iscool.nix).

## License
I don't care much about this, so MIT; see the `LICENSE` file.
